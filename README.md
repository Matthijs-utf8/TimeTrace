# TimeTrace

## Description

TimeTrace is an innovative timegrapher software, designed to address the specific needs and gaps in existing timegrapher tools. This Python-based open-source project is developed with the horology community in mind, aiming to provide a more accessible and feature-rich alternative to existing C-based solutions.

Key features of TimeTrace include:
- **Live Visual and Audio Feedback:** Real-time monitoring of timegrapher readings.
- **Modular User Interface:** Customizable interface to suit various user preferences.
- **Advanced Filtering and Signal Processing:** Precise control for accurate measurements.
- **Recording and Revisiting Audio Files:** Ability to save, upload, and review watch measurement audio files.
- **Automated Report Generation:** Streamlined creation of detailed reports from measurements.

This project is currently in its beta development stage, incorporating an imperfect but functional user interface, with ongoing efforts to enhance its capabilities. As a community-driven initiative, TimeTrace not only invites feedback and suggestions but also actively seeks collaboration from those skilled in programming, signal processing, or related fields.
